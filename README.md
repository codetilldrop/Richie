# Richie

## NOTE: THIS GAME IS IN DEVELOPMENT
## Concept

The concept of Richie involves users making 5 choices (based of skills about investing) out of a given set of options. There 5 choices are then evalutated and based off the wisdom of their investment decisions, they earn income for those 5 particular choices which represent a year. When the user chooses to end the game their total income over time is displayed. This can be used as an educational resource to help teach people unfamiliar with investing some important lessons.
